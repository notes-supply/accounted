/**
 * Probable underlag for a bank transaction, among the inbox items nobody has
 * matched to anything yet.
 *
 * Why this is needed at all: every surface finds underlag through
 * invoice_inbox_items.matched_transaction_id, and WhatsApp intake never writes
 * it. process-inbound.ts calls uploadAndExtract with its matchedTransactionId
 * argument undefined, so upload-and-extract.ts inserts NULL, and it does not
 * set transactions.document_id either (that mirror is written by the manual
 * match route). Only TransactionMatchPicker fills either column. So a user who
 * photographs a receipt into WhatsApp, opens the app and clicks the bank
 * transaction has an underlag that no lookup can reach: the assistant reports
 * "UNDERLAG: saknas" about a receipt we are holding, and asks again for answers
 * they already gave in chat.
 *
 * Candidates are PROPOSALS, never links. Nothing here writes
 * matched_transaction_id; the caller surfaces the candidate and a human
 * confirms it, so the existing "a person links the underlag" step stays intact
 * rather than being quietly automated.
 *
 * Core lib: must not import from @/extensions. The scoring half is pure so the
 * ranking is unit-testable without a database.
