/**
 * Kontantmetoden year-end cut-off (BFL 5 kap 2 §).
 *
 * Under kontantmetoden (bokslutsmetoden) affärshändelser are booked when cash
 * moves, so open customer and supplier invoices never reach 1510 / 2440 during
 * the year. BFL still requires that fordringar och skulder ARE booked at
 * räkenskapsårets utgång, so the year-end needs a cut-off entry that puts every
 * still-outstanding invoice onto the balance sheet.
 *
 * Moms is the part that is easy to get wrong. Under bokslutsmetoden moms is
 * reported at payment, so the cut-off must NOT push moms into the current
 * momsdeklaration. BAS provides "vilande" (dormant) moms accounts for exactly
 * this: 2618/2628/2638 for utgående and 2648 for ingående. They are absent from
 * ACCOUNT_RUTA / ACCOUNT_TO_BOX by design, so anything parked there stays out
 * of the declaration until the invoice is actually paid. Booking cut-off moms
 * to 2611/2641 instead would claim it a period early, which is the real error
 * this module exists to avoid.
 *
 * Shape: two aggregate verifikat (one for fordringar, one for skulder), each
 * reversed on the first day of the following period. Deliberately NOT
 * per-invoice, and deliberately not linked through invoices.journal_entry_id:
 *
 *  - the payment flows route on whether a live journal-entry link exists, so
 *    linking here would make every new-year payment take the accrual clearing
 *    path against a receivable the reversal has already removed, booking the
 *    settlement twice;
 *  - leaving the link unset means a new-year payment still books the normal
 *    kontantmetoden cash entry (revenue/expense + real moms at the payment
 *    date), which is what bokslutsmetoden requires.
 *
 * The reversal is what makes that safe: cut-off on the last day of the year,
 * vändning on the first day of the next, and the ledger is back to a pure cash
 * basis before any new-year payment is booked.
