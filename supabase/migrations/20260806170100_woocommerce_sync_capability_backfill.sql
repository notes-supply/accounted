-- Backfill capability_grants for the new 'woocommerce_sync' capability.
--
-- woocommerce_sync joins PAID_CAPABILITIES, but existing companies' grants
-- were written by the billing webhook / trial seeding BEFORE this key existed,
-- and are only refreshed on the next subscription event. Without a backfill,
-- every current payer and trialer would see the WooCommerce integration as not
-- entitled until their next webhook. Mirror each existing bank_sync grant (the
-- same sibling used by the stripe_payments backfill, 20260712100100) with
-- identical scope, source and expiry, so entitlement state stays exactly
-- aligned.
--
-- Idempotent: the (scope, key, source) unique index makes re-runs no-ops.
